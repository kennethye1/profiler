/**
 * This component is responsible for installing and updating the service worker,
 * possibly displaying an information notice for the user to switch to the new
 * service worker and reload the page whenever a new version is ready and we're
 * in a state that would accept a reload.
 *
 * Here are some assumptions:
 * - The browser checks for an update (in background) only when registering the
 *   SW, when the webapp starts up. There are other cases where this happens but
 *   this is more rare, especially for us where there's not much network traffic.
 * - By the time we have a symbolicated profile displayed, everything that
 *   should be downloaded is already downloaded.
 *
 * This means that we can force the new service worker at that time: this
 * shouldn't disturb other open tabs that are probably fully loaded already, nor
 * this current tab that is also fully loaded.
 *
 * If we didn't force the new service worker, then, to update, the user would
 * have to close all tabs first. This is not very nice, especially that it's
 * common that our users have several tabs open.
 *
 * We decided to force the new service worker only when the user clicks the
 * reload button. Here is why:
 * - As said above, it's common that our users have several tabs open.
 * - Other tabs will likely be "fully loaded".
 * - Therefore other tabs will trigger the update, even though the current tab
 *   isn't ready.
 * That's why the conscious user action is useful: 1/ this gives an "artisanal"
 * timeout, which could allow the symbolication to finish, and 2/ the user knows
 * something happens and is in control of it.
 *
 * But be wary that this breaks the F5 capability: the user will _have_ to
 * click the button to update (or close all tabs like said above).
 *
 * In the future we could store "processing in progress" profiles in a local
 * indexeddb. Then it would be easy to reload the page in case some module
 * loading fails, and resume the process after the reload.
